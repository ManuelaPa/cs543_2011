Projects from last year

1. Integrate depth camera with color camera; fill in missing depth information

2. 3D Reconstruction from two views + augmented reality.  Get 3D model of scene and insert synthetic object.

3. Detect edges in hallway and use edge detections to choose robot path.

4. 3D reconstruction from multiple views

5. Text recognition in natural images

6. Survey object recognition methods from VOC and implement one

7. Track gazes using stereo camera, plus third camera to watch eyes

8. Calibration of stereo cameras to get 3D view, working with Berkeley Tele-immersion system.
   
9. Automatically detect shadows in images and remove them.

10. Single image albedo and shading decomposition

11. Register microscopic and spectroscopic images
   
12. Stereo estimation from pair of images
